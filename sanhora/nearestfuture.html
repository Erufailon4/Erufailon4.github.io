    By the time I realised it, I had already started running <br/>
    While my heart trembled within me <br/>
    The white shadow grew distant behind me <br/>
    But I didn't turn back to look even once <br/>
     <br/>
I gathered that the season of lives fading away <br/>
Would pierce through my heart in time <br/>
And as the deep darkness drew nearer <br/>
I felt I would never see daylight again <br/>
 <br/>
My heart itself felt like it was floundering <br/>
So I caught it in my arms, holding onto it desperately <br/>
And the long slope leading up towards the starry sky <br/>
I truly thought it could continue on for all eternity <br/>
 <br/>
The flowers' blossom and decay <br/>
Repeat on and on, ever since the age of gods <br/>
But I've not once <br/>
Found that to be beautiful <br/>
 <br/>
The transient shadow continues to scramble for <br/>
The spring sun, up in the sky <br/>
But I've not once <br/>
Found beauty in its efforts <br/>
 <br/>
I live on, all the while resigning to my fate <br/>
As if not wanting anything at all...  <br/>
But I never let go <br/>
Of that final wish of mine, and continued running up...  <br/>
